### Women as Bridge Nodes (from zero_draft.md lines 140-154)

Now Girard also touches on who does not make a good scapegoat (and the answer may surprise you):

> It is clearly legitimate to define the difference between sacrificeable and nonsacrificeable individuals in terms of their degree of integration, but such a definition is not yet sufficient. In many cultures women are not considered full-fledged members of their society; yet women are never, or rarely, selected as sacrificial victims. There may be a simple explanation for this fact. The married woman retains her ties with her parents' clan even after she has become in some respects the property of her husband and his family. To kill her would be to run the risk of one of the two groups' interpreting her sacrifice as an act of murder, committing it to a reciprocal act of revenge.

This brings us back to the bridge nodes, you can think of a woman given from one family to another as a kind of bridge between the two communities. Scapegoating her would likely not lead to unanimous agreement among the two clans but bifurcation:

### Escalation Between Communities (from zero_draft.md lines 155-167)

Such an affront though would likely not go unheeded, instead the one family would escalate in vengence against the other for the scapegoating of their member:

The end state is two mutually antagonistic communities, although the two are mostly disconnected they are each unified against the individual member of the opposite community who has been designated as the scapegoat.

This is not a version of the scapegoat phenomenon that I have seen Girard discuss in any depth, but it makes sense, in order for a Montigue to hate a Capulat, he need not know and hate every Capulat, he might only hate ___ who first ____. perhaps after so many generations of infighting the scapegoat is no longer an individual but the concept of the Montigues themselves. And just by virtue of this hatred, were a Capulat to meet any Montigue on the street, they would be enemies automatically by association.

This mechanism not only establishes a hatred of the victim but also a unity among the persecutors—taking each respective community that was previously divided and making them unified against the common enemy.

Thus we've arrived at something actually quite [Schmittian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Schmitt) in nature: defining the political in terms of your enemy.

Thus if we return back to our Trump graph, we can see it in a new light: here Trump is the scapegoat of one community (the Democrats) while being defended by the other (the Republicans).

You see the same mechanism in foreign affairs: take the case of WWII, there is the scapegoating of a specific individual, Hitler, in propaganda and ridiculous cartoons, who stands in for the whole German nation. The allies thus are able to unify themselves against the common enemy of Hitler and the concept of the German nation and were they to meet a German on the battlefield, they are obviously automatic enemies to the point where they immediately start trying to kill each other.

### The Big List (from zero_draft.md lines 169-177)

Now what is important here is not the guilt or innocence of the scapegoat but the fact that the mechanism of coalescence around them is the same and has the same unifying effect—it is that this is the same mechanism that unified montigue against capulat, libs against trump, allies against hitler, germans against the jews, the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, the french people against marie antoinette, the KKK against blacks, the people of Salem against witches, the *mobile vulgus* against Jesus.

None of these are morally equivalent instances—and when we say that we mean that the appointed victim is in some cases "innocent" and in other cases "guilty"—but just looking at the list in each case the persecutors had their very thoroughly defined reasons for their persecution, and though we may look back at one or the other and say "oh they were unjust in doing that" and most of the work of history these days is to do just that—morally grandstanding from the lofty heights of modernity back on the evil past—the useful thing in analyzing these events wie sie eigentlich gewesen sind (as they actually were) is to see the mechanism of scapegoating underlying all.

Perhaps you were wondering earlier why you should care about all this graph and math stuff. It is because it allows us to better understand and unmask the social madnesses that we use to organize ourselves. And doing so allows us to illuminate the darker aspects of our past, present, and humanity in general in a new revealing light.

## Notes for Future Development

This content should be developed into a separate post on:
- Inter-group conflict dynamics
- How failed scapegoating (bridge targets) leads to polarization
- Escalation cycles between communities
- The Schmittian political dimension (friend/enemy distinction)
- Historical examples of group-vs-group scapegoating

Consider structure:
1. Setup: When scapegoating fails (bridge nodes)
2. Bifurcation: Two communities form around defending/attacking
3. Escalation: Counter-scapegoating creates symmetrical hostility
4. Fragmented unification: Each group unites internally against external enemy
5. Political implications: Schmitt, tribalism, warfare
6. Historical examples (with appropriate sensitivity to moral differences)
